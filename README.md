# sv

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`sv`](https://github.com/sveltejs/cli).

## Requirements

You need Node.js and `pnpm` installed. You can install `pnpm` globally with:

```sh
npm install -g pnpm
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `pnpm install`, start a development server:

```sh
pnpm run dev
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```sh
pnpm build
```

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.
